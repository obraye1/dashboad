# Dashboard Project

This project is a dashboard built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface for displaying important data and metrics.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository onto your local machine.
Navigate to the root directory of the project.
Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Run npm run dev to start the development server.
Dependencies
This project uses the following dependencies:

Next.js - A framework for building React applications.
Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework.
React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

# Folder Structure

The project is structured as follows:
dashboard/
|- components/
|- pages/
|- public/
|- styles/

The components folder contains reusable React components.
The pages folder contains the main pages of the application.
The public folder contains static files such as images and fonts.
The styles folder contains global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
